/*! \brief Performs a reduce operation on the columns of an array.
 *  \details Computes the minimum element for each row in an array.
 *  \note When there are multiple rows in the array, a reduce operation 
 *        is performed per row, in parallel.
 *  \note The number of elements, `N`, in a row of the array should be a **multiple 
 *        of 4** (the data are handled as `float4`). The **x** dimension of the 
 *        global workspace, \f$ gXdim \f$, should be greater or equal to the number of 
 *        elements in a row of the array divided by 8. That is, \f$ \ gXdim \geq N/8 \f$. 
 *        Each work-item handles `8 float` (= `2 float4`) elements in a row of the array. 
 *        The **y** dimension of the global workspace, \f$ gYdim \f$, should be equal 
 *        to the number of rows, `M`, in the array. That is, \f$ \ gYdim = M \f$. 
 *        The local workspace should be `1` in the **y** dimension, and a 
 *        **power of 2** in the **x** dimension. It is recommended 
 *        to use one `wavefront/warp` per work-group.
 *  \note When the number of elements per row of the array is small enough to be 
 *        handled by a single work-group, the output array will contain the true 
 *        minimums. When the elements are more than that, they are partitioned 
 *        into blocks and reduced independently. In this case, the kernel 
 *        outputs the minimums from each block reduction. A reduction should then be
 *        made on those minimums for the final results. The number of work-groups
 *        in the **x** dimension, \f$ wgXdim \f$, **for the case of multiple 
 *        work-groups**, should be made a **multiple of 4**. The potential extra 
 *        work-groups are used for enforcing correctness. They write the necessary
 *        identity operands, `INFINITY`, in the output array, since in the next phase 
 *        the data are going to be handled as `float4`.
 *
 *  \param[in] in input array of `float` elements.
 *  \param[out] out (reduced) output array of `float` elements. When the kernel is
 *                  dispatched with one work-group per row, the array contains the 
 *                  final results, and its size should be \f$ rows*sizeof\ (float) \f$.
 *                  When the kernel is dispatched with more than one work-groups per row,
 *                  the array contains the results from each block reduction, and its size 
 *                  should be \f$ wgXdim*rows*sizeof\ (float) \f$.
 *  \param[in] data local buffer. Its size should be `2 float` elements for each 
 *                  work-item in a work-group. That is \f$ 2*lXdim*sizeof\ (float) \f$.
 *  \param[in] n number of elements in a row of the array divided by 4.
